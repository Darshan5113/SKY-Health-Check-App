        <strong>Green:</strong> Select this when the team is performing strongly in this area.
        Everything is functioning as expected — there are no blockers, issues, or risks that require escalation.
        The team is confident in their current processes and practices related to this health card.
        Stakeholders are informed, work is on track, and there’s no immediate need for major changes or improvements.
        This status reflects a healthy and sustainable condition that can be maintained going forward.

    <!-- Amber -->
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-4">
      <img src="{% static 'images/yellow_vote.png' %}" alt="Amber" width="40" class="me-3">
      <div>
        <strong>Amber:</strong> Select this when there are some concerns or areas for improvement.
        While the team is making progress, there may be minor issues, blockers, or risks that require attention — but nothing critical.
        Support or corrective action might be needed to ensure things stay on track.
        The team is aware of the situation and actively working on it, but improvements are not yet fully realized.
        This status indicates a warning sign, not a failure — it's a prompt to keep an eye on this area before it escalates.

    <!-- Red -->
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-4">
      <img src="{% static 'images/red_vote.png' %}" alt="Red" width="40" class="me-3">
      <div>
        <strong>Red:</strong>  Select this when the situation is critical and demands immediate attention.
        The team is facing serious challenges, progress has stalled, or the outcomes are far from expectations.
        There may be major blockers, unresolved issues, lack of clarity, or failure in communication and execution.
        This status highlights a major risk or failure that cannot be ignored — urgent support, intervention, or a change in approach is required to recover.
        Think of Red as a call to action — not to place blame, but to acknowledge the severity and initiate swift corrective measures.
